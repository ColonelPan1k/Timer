# Timer

This is just a simple program that records the execution time of whatever program is passed to it.  I wrote this to play around with fork(), exec(), and wait().

I also added some test programs, the best of which being an implementation of bogosort.  I don't think it's the most efficient implementation of bogosort but it's
bogosort so it's not really supposed to be efficient.  In the future I might split off bogosort into its own program and add in some basic multithreading to get more
experience with fork()-ing things.
